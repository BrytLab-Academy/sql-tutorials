--Users table

-- user_courses table
```
mysql> select * from user_courses;
+---------+-----------+-------+
| user_id | course_id | score |
+---------+-----------+-------+
|       1 |         1 |    55 |
|       1 |         2 |    87 |
|       1 |         3 |    78 |
|       2 |         1 |    62 |

9 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

The three columns in `user_courses` table represent the score on each user in a particlular course.
For instance, the first row the user_id 1 represent usr Kofi, and course_id 1 represents Geography.
Hence Kofi has a score of 55 in Geography.

To make this table easy to understand, let's replace the `user_id` and the `course_id` with the user name and the course name respectively.
We can do this using the inner join.

--Replace user_id and course_id with user name and course name respectively using inner join.
```
mysql>  select 
          users.name as user_name, 
          courses.name as course_name,
          user_courses.score
        from 
          users 
          inner join user_courses on users.id = user_courses.user_id
          inner join courses on courses.id = user_courses.course_id
        order by user_name;
+-----------+-------------+-------+
| user_name | course_name | score |
+-----------+-------------+-------+
| Abena     | Law         |    79 |
| Abena     | History     |    88 |
| Abena     | Geography   |    85 |
| Ama       | Geography   |    62 |
| Ama       | Law         |    59 |
| Ama       | History     |    92 |
| Kofi      | Law         |    78 |
| Kofi      | History     |    87 |
| Kofi      | Geography   |    55 |
+-----------+-------------+-------+
9 rows in set (0.12 sec)
```

This view looks more presentable. But there is one problem here.
There are only three users but we have 9 rows with each row representing a course enrolled by a user.
We can transform this row into colums so that  we would have only three rows: each row representing a user.
And five columns : one for the user names and the rest to the four courses. 
This will create a grid-like table with each intersectin representing a course enrolled by a user.

--Pivot table
```
mysql>  select user_name,
            max( case when course_name='Geography' then score  end)  Geography,
            max( case when course_name='Law' then score end)  Law,
            max( case when course_name='History' then score end)  History
        from
          (
            select 
              users.name as user_name, 
              courses.name as course_name,
              user_courses.score
            from 
              users 
              inner join user_courses on users.id = user_courses.user_id
              inner join courses on courses.id = user_courses.course_id
          ) as inner_table
        group by user_name
        order by user_name;
+-----------+-----------+------+---------+
| user_name | Geography | Law  | History |
+-----------+-----------+------+---------+
| Abena     |        85 |   79 |      88 |
| Ama       |        62 |   59 |      92 |
| Kofi      |        55 |   78 |      87 |
+-----------+-----------+------+---------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```


We can also apply aggregate functions on the result of a pivot table. 
In this scenario, we can calculate the total score of each user accross all courses.
```
mysql>  select user_name,
          max( case when course_name='Geography' then score  end)  Geography,
          max( case when course_name='Law' then score end)  Law,
          max( case when course_name='History' then score end)  History,
          sum(score) as total_score
        from 
          (
            select 
          users.name as user_name, 
          courses.name as course_name,
          user_courses.score
        from 
          users 
          inner join user_courses on users.id = user_courses.user_id
          inner join courses on courses.id = user_courses.course_id
        ) as inner_table
        group by user_name
        order by user_name;
+-----------+-----------+------+---------+-------------+
| user_name | Geography | Law  | History | total_score |
+-----------+-----------+------+---------+-------------+
| Abena     |        85 |   79 |      88 |         252 |
| Ama       |        62 |   59 |      92 |         213 |
| Kofi      |        55 |   78 |      87 |         220 |
+-----------+-----------+------+---------+-------------+
3 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

This structure looks perfect at the moment. 
Let's insert a new user into the `users` table and assign only on course to this user and check the output of the pivot query agian.


-- Add one more user.
```
mysql> insert into users(name) value ('Musa');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.12 sec)
```

-- Assign only one course to the user Musa
```
mysql>  insert into user_courses(user_id, course_id, score) 
        values 
          (4, 3, 96);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.07 sec)
```


This is the out put from the pivot query above.
```
+-----------+-----------+------+---------+-------------+
| user_name | Geography | Law  | History | total_score |
+-----------+-----------+------+---------+-------------+
| Abena     |        85 |   79 |      88 |         252 |
| Ama       |        62 |   59 |      92 |         213 |
| Kofi      |        55 |   78 |      87 |         220 |
| Musa      |      NULL |   96 |    NULL |          96 |
+-----------+-----------+------+---------+-------------+
4 rows in set (0.03 sec)
```

We can see `NULL` values at the Geography and History columns for Musa because he is not enrolled in these courses.
We can use the  coalesce function to replace each  `NULL` value with a meaningfull value.
In this case, we will use 'Not enrolled'

mysql>  select user_name,
          coalesce( max( case when course_name='Geography' then score end), 'Not enrolled')  Geography,
          coalesce( max( case when course_name='Law' then score end), 'Not enrolled')  Law,
          coalesce( max( case when course_name='History' then score end), 'Not enrolled')  History,
          sum(score) as total_score
        from 
          (
          select 
            users.name as user_name, 
            courses.name as course_name,
            user_courses.score
          from 
            users 
            inner join user_courses on users.id = user_courses.user_id
            inner join courses on courses.id = user_courses.course_id
        ) as inner_table
        group by user_name
        order by user_name;
+-----------+--------------+------+--------------+-------------+
| user_name | Geography    | Law  | History      | total_score |
+-----------+--------------+------+--------------+-------------+
| Abena     | 85           | 79   | 88           |         252 |
| Ama       | 62           | 59   | 92           |         213 |
| Kofi      | 55           | 78   | 87           |         220 |
| Musa      | Not enrolled | 96   | Not enrolled |          96 |
+-----------+--------------+------+--------------+-------------+
